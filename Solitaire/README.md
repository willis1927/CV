 # YOUR PROJECT TITLE

    #### Description:
    My project is a replication of the card game solitaire

    On running the program the user is presented with a set of instructions and a "deck of cards" dealt out ready to play in 7 piles

    The aim of the game is to promote all cards to their respective Ace piles in sequential order.

    Use can move cards on top of each other as long as there are sequential and alternating colour of suit.

    Users can also draw cards from a deck to add or move around the game

    By defualt the user draws 3 cards from the deck, this can be changed within the game using the c command

    If the user runs out of moves and wants to restart they can do so with the r command

    Once all Ace piles have been filled the game is complete and the user will be presented with a message confirming this and asking if they would like to start a new game or exit

    Whilst play the game the user can promtoe cards to the ace deck by either inputing p alone to promote from the deck or p followed by a pile number to promote the bottom card from that pile

    When a use wants to move a card from the deck to a pile they do this by entering the numebr of the deck as a move

    if a user wants to move cards from one pile to another they do so using the m command, they are then prompted for the piles they would like to move between and the numebr of cards

    if a pile is empty a king can be moved to this pile

    If all revealed cards are moved off a deck the next unrevealed card is turned over

    If during the game the user runs out of moves they can restart the game using the r command
